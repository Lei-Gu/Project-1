## Team members

## Project description/outline
We are a software startup researching our next product and are looking for potentially lucrative niches. So we can develop a better understanding of usage of mobile apps across iPhone and Android platforms, we want to analyze available app store data.

## Research questions to answer (updated)
 - Which categories have the highest number of available apps? 
 - Which categories have the highest number of installs?
 - What is the average price per category? (discounting free apps)
 - What distribution of free v. paid apps across categories
 - How do ratings correlate with installs?
 - How do reviews correlate with installs?
 - How does size correlate with installs?
 - What is the correlation between days since last update and rating?

## Datasets to be used
 - [Google Play Store](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) (priority)
 - [Apple Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) (stretch goal)
 - In app-purchase data (if available)

## Rough breakdown of work

#### Refine questions
#### Access initial data set
#### Format dataset
 - _Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s)._
 - _Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process._
#### Illustrate analysis
 - _Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis._
 - _Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data)._
 - _Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation._
#### (Optional) Determine potential API strategy
 - _Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions._
#### Summarize findings
 - _Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots._
#### Prepare presentation and present!
