# Project 1: App store data analysis

## Team members
Daniella DeRose, Lei Gu, Grant Sisson, Andrew Suprenant

## Project description/outline
We are a software startup researching our next product and are looking for potentially lucrative niches. So we can develop a better understanding of usage of mobile apps across iPhone and Android platforms, we want to analyze available app store data.

## Research questions to answer (subject to change)
 - Which categories have the highest-price apps?
 - What are the most popular apps?
 - What app categories have the most users?
 - What is relative pricing across categories. Which are most/least expensive?
 - What is the impact of paid versus free on installs and ratings?

## Datasets to be used
 - [Apple Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)
 - [Google Play Store](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps)
 - In app-purchase data (if available)

## Rough breakdown of work

#### Refine questions
#### Access initial data set
#### Format dataset
 - _Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s)._
 - _Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process._
#### Illustrate analysis
 - _Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis._
 - _Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data)._
 - _Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation._
#### Determine potential API strategy
 - _(Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions._
#### Summarize findings
 - _Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots._
#### Prepare presentation and present!
